# Calculator from School

In elementary school I remember whenever we would do math, we would be given these small blue calculator with red buttons. So while I was thinking of little things I could build with react this came to my mind and I decided why not?

The goal of this is to end up with something that looks as close as I can remember those calculators looking to work on design a little, and to function like those calculators did (which shouldn't be hard considering the real thing seemed to barely function).
